### covid-tracker
#### Overview
This program uses the [Canadian Covid Tracking API](https://api.covid19tracker.ca/docs/1.0/overview) to provide provincial data on covid-19.
#### How it works
The user enters a [province code](https://github.com/VanshBhandari/covid-tracker/blob/main/provincecodes.txt) and the algorithm searches through the [provincial Covid-19 data](https://api.covid19tracker.ca/summary/split) to return a summary on the relevant province. It then adds this summary to [province data files](https://github.com/VanshBhandari/covid-tracker/tree/main/province%20covid%20data) and stores it for future reference. This dataset can be used to track the status of Covid-19 in different Canadian provinces.
